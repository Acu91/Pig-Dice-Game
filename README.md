Pig is a simple, fun dice game that is often used to teach probability and strategy. It can be played by two or more players with just a single six-sided die. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach or exceed a target score, typically 100 points.

Rules
Gameplay:

Players take turns rolling the die as many times as they wish during their turn.
The total of the numbers rolled during a turn is added to the player's current turn score.
A player may choose to "hold" at any time during their turn. When holding, the turn score is added to their total score, and their turn ends.
Special Rule - Rolling a 1:

If the player rolls a 1 at any point during their turn:
Their turn ends immediately.
They score 0 points for that turn, losing all points accumulated during that turn.
Winning the Game:

The first player to reach or exceed the target score (e.g., 100 points) wins.
If two or more players exceed the target score in the same round, the one with the higher total score wins.
