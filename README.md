## Rules and Gameplay

### General Rules
- Players take turns rolling the die as many times as they wish during their turn.
- The total of the numbers rolled during a turn is added to the player's **turn score**.
- A player can choose to **"hold"** at any time during their turn:
  - When holding, the **turn score** is added to the player's **total score**.
  - The player's turn ends.

### Special Rule - Rolling a 1
- If the player rolls a **1** at any point during their turn:
  - Their turn ends immediately.
  - They score **0 points** for that turn, losing all points accumulated during the turn.

### Winning the Game
- The first player to reach or exceed the target score (e.g., 100 points) wins.
- If two or more players exceed the target score in the same round, the player with the **higher total score** wins.

## Example Gameplay

1. **Player A rolls a 4 and a 5:**
   - **Turn score = 4 + 5 = 9**
   - Player A chooses to "hold."
   - Player A's **total score** increases by 9.

2. **Player B rolls a 3, a 6, and then a 1:**
   - Turn ends immediately due to rolling a 1.
   - Player B scores **0 points** for this turn.

3. The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds the target score.

## Strategy Tips
- Decide whether to "hold" or "roll" based on your current score, your opponent's score, and your risk tolerance.
- Holding with a moderate turn score (e.g., 15â€“20 points) can reduce the risk of rolling a 1 and losing the turn's points.
